### Aqua-Phyto


#### A fully automated algae bioreactor




### "Water Plant"


Notebook scan


That's what AquaPhyto roughly means in english, and it's about as close to "Algae" as you can get in ancient greek. My goal is to create a fully automatic system so that you can cultivate algae anywhere anytime at the push of a button. Simply pour in your medium, add a dash of your sample and watch it go to work. The AquaPhyto measures the measuring Nitrate (N), Phosphate (P), Potassium (K), Temp(T), Humidity (H) and pH then pushes them to a website, it also allowss actions like pump control and agitation cycle to be controlled from the website. When your ready to extract some of it for testing simple turn press a button and watch it filter out the water.

#### 1st model failure




### Development Hell


Image Description


I tried: 1 pump: Nothing2 pumps in series: Nothing2 pump in series with one way valve: Nothing2 pump in series with one way valve at 1/4 water level: Nothing1 pump with one way valve: Nothing 1 pump with one way valve at 1/4 water level: Very small bubbles for a short period After trial, error and flooding my bathroom a dozen times this is what i have boiled it all down too. The water itself is enacting force backwards onto the input line. Leading to air not being able to force it's way through even with the pump and one way valve, at least to a useable extent. Even with the one way valve there is a back-force that arises once the pumps are turned off, i am guessing this comes about due to air being pushed through past the one way value building into a large air gap of a higher pressure then when power is cut off there is a large enough "push" enacted by the force of the main water tank to push it through the one way valve and then upwards to the collection area leading to major leaks from that point after power to the pump is turned off. This is a major issue and would ruin stuff in any sort of uncontrolled environment by flooding it with water. So all in all the system still functions as a core concept but the way i designed the intake and outtake systems for the water alongside how pressure and flow in managed within those systems needs a total redesign to be anywhere near functional.

### So how?


Image Description


The results of failure are all well and good recorded but serve nothing if not reapplied. So let's design a system that allows air to be pumped in this way, knowing what we know now about water's flow. So if we know that water exerts a down-water force, let's make sure our air doped water is also pumped downwards then the bouncy will lift the bubbles back up naturally. We only have to overcome the force of pushing away a small layer of water at the outtakes exit, instead of all water contained within the container.
