### 3D printed Screwdriver


#### total cost: Only $1.04




### base model


I started with a basic LTT screwdriver 3d print mockup (not exactly the same as one pictured)but I didn't have access to a proper metal bit holder and I didn't like how the bit holder didn't shut fully in place.

### Version 0.1: Magnetic bit storage


Magnet holder shown


I then ordered some smallÂ neodymium magnets, after they arrived I got to work modeling and testing different sized 3d printed holders until I got one with a tight fit. I then integrated this magnet holder into both the inner section on the driver and the bottom section of the bit holder. This was to ensure that the whole system would close properly and not move during transit.

### Version 0.2: Magnetic adapter max


I then got to work testing a bunch of hex shafts until I found one that fit the screwdriver, I then polished up the model and built in a slot where another magnet will be placed so that the given bit will be able to snap on and itself become magnetic. It also added a horizontal bolt and nut that can be screwed in if the magnet isn't strong enough during the given task.

### Version 0.3: Adapter min


I then created the adapter to convert the larger hex bolt of screwdriver to the same size bits that I have in my kit. The bottom is open so that the magnet from the larger adapter still has a strong effect.

I was not able to make the screw on the adapter work do to the limits of my 3d printer's nozzle size, so it was removed
