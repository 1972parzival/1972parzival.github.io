#### Steps


1. Mix all ingredients2. Stir the bowl until the solution appears as a solid white (similar to the color of milk)3. Stir the bowl above a pot of boiling water until it's thick with high viscosity (takes between 6-10 minutes depending on size of batch)4. Pour the solution into the plastic mold or covered metal tray5. Leave in view of the sun, such as a window sill for 8 days

### Results after 2 days: Failure


It seems that the given ratio of glycerin was too high and it appears to have become more of a gel like substance. Though this is not the desired result it's by far the closest I've got, with a few more adjustments I think I can get a proper plastic. It regard to this "gel" substance it is very interesting, it's quite strong when compared to similar substances and i could see it being used in products such as: pillows? Shoe soles? Fabrics? Kids toys? Coats? To conduct or insulate heat? keep in mind it's still 100% biodegradable
