### Spray Assist


#### a tool to assist in holding a spray can and getting consistent coats and easy shaking




### Version 0.1


This was a extremely basic model of a spray paint mount I  found online. The can was extremely unstable and the handle was very weak and broke upon any attempt to use it. My goal is to make a proper easy to use version and make it easier to print on more printers. I plan to add a ring hole and proper grooves to the handle. Remove the unneeded side logo to reduce the chance of print failure. Add a secondary mount system to improve stability that attaches through a nuts and bolts system. Add a circle base so the system can lie flat on it's bottom. and of course, add my own logo:0

### Version 0.2


The handle worked great regarding grip and control the can. Though the handle did snap, I believe this can be easily fixed by properly reinforcing the handle to be able to control grip force easily. The slide nut blocks looked and felt great, although it would appear one nut was modeled backwards and wouldn't work at all. The top of the handle grip needs to be properly redesigned as right now it had to be canceled so it didn't print complex upper sections of the original grip model.

### Version 0.3


Discussed most of issues in 0.2 notes. Here are the main changes:1. Properly reinforcing the handle2. Added logo3. Fixed reversed nut on 1 sidenotes noticed: Handle is definitely reinforced but also has a harder time moving within the more limited spacethe added logo printed great but is slightly off center it is a good enough base model so i am now going to start on the connector

### Version 0.4


Working on the connector system that will attach the base to the holder using the nut bolt system already discussed0.4 is a very rough model to get an idea of possible changes notes: 1 side fits great but the right hand side seems to have been shifted too far away from the center and doesn't line up with the nut hole. The main column is too close to the spray can and leads to bending instead of a flush fit.

### version 0.5


Fixed the issue of bolt alignment and also add a a proper base that fits nicely and is flush with the base model. main column was also moved so that it is flush with the side of spray paint can.

### version 0.6 and 0.7


Working on the holder system that will allow the connector system to to attach properly to it using a nuts and bolts attachment. New additions to the holder part include: A properly bottom so it can more securely hold a can and also allows it to sit flatly on a normal surface. Extended area of length that includes the nut required. new problems: Area between base and connector keeps breaking under stress testingthere is too much flex between at the bottom of connector

### version 0.8 and 0.9


Notes: Area between base and connector keeps breaking under stress testing so we are going to increase the surface area of the base by 269.25% to reduce the chances of failure. There is too much flex between at the bottom of connector so I am adding a addition screw and hole. Those are the only changes not worth showing extra photos alongside two time lapses almost identical to 0.6 and 0.7

### Version 1.0

I've been dreading having to do this since 0.1 but it seems that the handle mechanism on the base  is fundamentally flawed. I am going to have to redesign it. Because of the less rotation allowed because of changes made to reinforce the handle in 0.3, it makes sense to do a basic gear system so that a low movement of high force in handle movement will allow for a large movement of low force in the area that presses down on the spray paint. This also allowss for even more fine adjustments for the user in the amount of paint being dispensed! The best way to design this will likely be in "FreeCad" like we did in first 3d model.

### Version 1.1


After weeks of testing i could not correctly design a reliable solution for a geared handle mechanism on the base but, i found that by increasing the infill of the base to 60-70% and using a triangle infill i was able to get a handle that "never" broke in testing. However a new issue i have encounter is that of the the handle doesn't have enough movement forward as it is being blocked by the connector piece.

### Version 1.2


To addressss the issue outlined in 1.1 I have remodeled the connecter piece so that it has a lot of space, so that handle can easily reach it maximum point forward. It's supported by 2 thin cylinders on right triangles on the bottom along with two more right triangles on the top. Along though 2 new problems have occurred. 1. Because of how wide the 2 cylinders are, the screws that allow the connecter to attach to the base are not able to be screwed in.2. The top screw that allows the holder to the connecter cannot fit due to the large diameter of the of the cylinders

### Version 1.3


To fix the issues mentioned in 1.2 i reduced the width of the upper right triangles and the two cylinders. I also added a square indent so that the holder and the connecter will be able to lie flush and be screwed together correctly.

### Version 1.4


This is to fix an issue where the base bolt is too tall and hit's against the user's hand when holding around the handle. We can fix this by merely reducing the size of the bolt by 6mm from ~54 to ~48. We are only reducing the head of the bolt of course so that the bolt still threads correctly.
