##### This is a work in progress project


Many of the areas of text, images or information are not final and May contain erros




### Frequently asked questions


- L293D? Controls the flow of power and how is it connected including direction and speed to the high voltage motors in this project


- Arduino Uno? An Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board designed for beginners and hobbyists: It is an open-source platform, making it easy to use and modify for various projects. An Arduino Uno has input and output pins that allow you to connect sensors, actuators, and other components. With its user-friendly integrated development environment (IDE), you can write and upload code to control electronic devices, making it an excellent choice for prototyping and learning electronics.


- DC motor? Is an electrical device that turns electricity into movement. It has a spinning part (armature) and uses magnets to rotate when you apply power to it. DC motors are used in things like fans, toys, and many other devices that need motion.




### Motor testing


^ simple test of the motors(click on image for video)


Shown is a simple test of the motors using 2 batteries each being 1.5 volts for a combined voltage of 3.0v. While this is still significantly less then the 24.0v that the motors are meant to accept it can still be used as a basic test to ensure that the motors are functioning.

### Basic Manual Motor control


Image Description


We used splitter to convert the circle style power connecter to a simple + and - ports, those were then hooked up to a simple motor controller that allows us to control the speed of the motors using a simple knob. The motor controller also has a swhich so we have the ability to quick turn the motors on and off, along with swhiching the overall direction they turn. This functionality is a very similar to what the L293D chip can do.

### Bolts and Nuts Testing Prints


I used a basic model from thingiverse to help print some test screws that we will need to have to help build the final shell for the robot and also the connections between the motors and the 3d printed wheels
