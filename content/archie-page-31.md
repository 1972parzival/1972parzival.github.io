#### elementary science fair (2019)


This took place in 2019 and I displaced the basic idea of how Machine Learning works with a large amount of matchboxes, to play tic tac toe. This project was based the popular experiment known as MENACE by Artificial Intelligence researcher Donald Michie in 1961. I also showsed a basic machine vision model running on a Raspberry Pi 3.




#### Fish Feeder




#### Fish Feeder (2016)


The fish feeder as discussed in the video was a very basic system that contained a Arduino Uno, and a small servo motor attached to a plastic cup that holds fish food that is dispensed as it rotates. The entire enclosure for the system was made of Lego bricks because i was a small child.




#### LED hat




#### LED hat (2017)


This was a project made for a relative who loves hot sauce, it works by using a feather microcontroller and having a phone connect to it over Bluetooth. The user is then able to fully control what lights light up and when or choose from a collection of preprogrammed patterns.
