What is life? Life. Life is. Life is suffering. What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of suffering? To overcome the suffering. To Conquer it. To Conquer the suffering is meaning of life itself. That is the meaning of my life, a bold, brave, conquest.

I was born on a dairy farm. I lived at 67 Cooke Drive Googong, NSW 2620. It's hard to remember these early days of my life and yet I still have the memories like visions engraved into my head after years and years of recalling them. The earlies of these "memories" starts with me in the back of a car slowly turning right to view a gas station with a small local mall in the distance behind it. The car parking spaces outside the mall are quite empty but not completely. As my head pans left day turns into night and I see myself from a 3rd person view in the center dark room of a party surrounded by party go-ers all around my very young age. It seems like it's a glow in the dark party, as people have all shades of neon colored wristbands and necklaces. I appear to be happily dancing by myself near the center of the room, nobody is directly near me or is close to me. end of memory the next memories begins with me and a friend whose face and voice I cannot remember walking up a slightly steep hill, as I reach the top of hill I see a large wire cage that sit's atop a table next to a tree. As I continue to approach I can see the hay like grass on the bottom of the wire cage, within the cage sit 3 brown rabbits. My friend picks up a rabbit and lays it in my arms. I am extremely excited. End of memorythe final memory is that of the trail behind my house. A dusty brown gravel like trail with many hills. As I ride over the biggest hill on the trail and come to a stop at the bottom I look down to the valley parallel to the trail and see at least a dozen kangaroos in the valley and witness two kangaroos start to fight. The REST of the kangaroos move away from the fighters and merely stop and stare, just as I am. Eventually one of them is defeated and bounces off while the other returns to the large group of kangaroos. end of memoryI don't know why I have these memories, I don't know why they're so vivid, I don't know why I can only remember certain aspects. Are they dreams? Visions? True events merely faded in time? I have lived many places in my life, but that was the only place that I feel was truly my home. I remember leaving. I only remember one thing like a polaroid within my mind. It's the ocean as I look it from a plane early in the morning all I can out the window is a deep dark shade of blue ocean waves, no land in sight.

Fat. I used to be very fat. I was never very active during my younger years but even more so leading up to the start of covid. About a month into covid, my older brother (ben) convinced me that I should really start taking my fitness seriously or that I would surely die of obesity before the age of 50. So i started, it began mostly with a very old treadmill in my basement. He tell me to hop on it, and walk while watching old anime he enjoyed. It was absolutely painful at first and for the first few days i would sometimes have to hold onto the side of the treadmill or put my legs on either side and stop moving entirely. It was a long long process, but it did after a month see just a little bit of process. I hadn't lost any weight, but my breathing and pain while running had improved since the start. I tired to run a lot and even wanted to make progress by myself without ben looking over me. Ben also taught me the basics of meal prepping and how to cook basic meals while my mother was working during this time. Omelets, rice, bacon all high protein easy to cook foods. Eventually ben left and the habit slowly faded away. I then joined Minnetonka football, most of the people were pretty awful, but the coaches were very talented and the linemen (which I was a part) of did have a tight nit brotherhood about it. It was terrible pain but slowly i did manage to get thin for the first real time in my life. I was very thin but i didn't have any muscle, even with the "weight training" that we did after every 6 hour practice i didn't seem to be improving. After football season had ended i decided to compete in a marathon, nothing special just a normal 5km race. I came home and almost every single day i ran my routine. It was very simple and it will be engraved in my mind forever:"30mins at 6mph with 9mph for the last quarter mile"it was incredibly painful just had football had been, the burning pain of fat is truly awful thing. It was a pain i had brought upon myself, to further myself. Eventually the day of the race came, it was wet, very wet. It rain and it rained and it rain and still we raced. I didn't think about anything but breathing, pain, and my speed. Eventually i crossed the finish line and sat down on a bench thinking laughing about how i might never get up again. My goal was to have a overall speed of 7mph. My final time was 24:55 for 5km for about a average speed of 7.48 mph. I felt truly accomplished, even though i wasn't even close to the fastest it didn't matter i was faster then who i ever thought i could be. I then went on to do another year of football, joined a gym, and then decided to get into boxing as my older brother once did. I absolutely loved it. The pain, the movement, the controlled power. It truly got me into shape like nothing else did. Then i fell off the train once again, though i did learn a lot about electronics and other subjects i neglected my fitness and slowly i lost most of what i had built at my peak. Now i'm starting up again i've been getting back to the gym over the last 2 months are have got at least 3 times a week for the last few weeks and tracking every calorie i ever eat. You can always start again, you can always try again, you can always go for another rep. But know one thing for certain, you can lie to your friends, you can lie to your family, you can try to lie to yourself for a little bit. But the mirrors don't lie, the scales don't lie, the calories don't lie. Deep within yourself you truly know if your doing the right thing and deep down you know it's worth it.
