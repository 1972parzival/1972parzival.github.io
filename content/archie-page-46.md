### Two Way Air Cap




##### This project is a follow up to DIY Pressure Containers


Some of the major takeaways were not that bottles cannot act as pressure containers, in fact the very opposite they work great at small PSI levels. The problem lies in having a proper system for both inputting and outputting the pressure, that is what I hope to improve in this project




Initial sketch of the idea for an improvement

### Base models


I started off by importing the two base models I will need those being:- Schrader valve cap- Bottle cap with barred exit (that was previously used)

### Modeling

I started off with the base models and the progressively cut and copied while adding new elements and copying the most recent section after each improvement. This resulted in a sort of visible workflow, with the most recent models on the far left of the photo and the oldest models on the far right. I'm really happy with the final model

### Testing


View of one version sliced into pieces so you can get a cut through view


As I neared the final few models I checked each of them in my slider by cutting them in half to ensure that both the input and output valves correctly fed into the inner area and then fed correctly into the water bottle with no leaks or hole in the model/print

#### InitialÂ Results: Failure


The larger tube and the thread with a reduced amount of sealant did work, but the FDM printer with a 0.4 mm nozzle just wasn't detailed enough to get a proper thread for the bike pump and therefore no air tight seal could be made




##### PLA PRINT


##### METAL THEAD vs FILLED RESIN


##### UnFilled RESIN

### Un-Filled Thread Resin


Photo the latest print


After a lot of attempts i finally got another resin print and i made sure to blast it down with compressed air and ensured there was no resin that got stuck in the threads of the screw. Unfortunately even after days of slowly adding sealant and then testing i wasn't able to get the thread airtight enough to work with my electric air pump. I will continue this two way air cap system as part of a larger system and make a full post about that soon, but for this project at this time i'm going to have to call it a failure.
