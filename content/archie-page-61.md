### PIP smokers box


#### No. I don't smoke.




### Overview

I was recently approached to work a 3D printing product that is described as a "smoker's box". It is a small container that holds a common lighter and a small section for cigarettes. The current model uses a simple hinge from a filament line and doesn't for a tight fit. The Three goals for this improved design are:- Hinge (print in place) that can be easily printed - Latch system (PIP) to ensure contents are not spilled or spoiled - Highly water-resistant, if not totally waterproof

### Initial model

I started my printing out the initial model to get a better look at it and understand it's flaws:1. Really weak hinge (snapped quickly during tests)2. Gaps and seems around the edges3. Quality appears cheap when it is printed on the largest face as that is the bottom layer

### Latch testing


3 versions of the latch, from old to new


I started out with a regular latch that had a flush flat face build to be installed with screws based on a template. I then mounted it on a flat surface and removed the side mounting holes, alongside improving the latch "lip" itself so it took more force to unhook. Finally i improved the the latch itself so it was fully secure and fully print in place while easily "cracked in".

#### V1 notes


Both latch and hinge function well. After this the only notable requirement will be locking down the tolerances so it's more water-resistant. Then finer adjustments to reduce support and allow easier "cracking in" after printing. I also believe it May be worth flipping the side of the lighter as people are mainly right handed so they would be able to light it within the container easily.
