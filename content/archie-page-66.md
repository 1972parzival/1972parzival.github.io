### Make Sulfuric Acid at Home


#### (electrolysis of epsom salt)




### Description


In this guide i use electricity to turn common and cheap of epsom salt into Sulfuric Acid. It feels like i've done this a million times after both Making doing oxy-hydrogen and NaOH and it feel like electrolysis and electrochemistry is a extremely powerful asset to have. So this time i'm making Sulfuric Acid the reason i want to is mainly for creating my own lead acid battery in a coming project as i think that would be a awesome feat to have achieved. I also think that sulfuric acid is generally hard to get both in availability and price. So i offer you this guide of making it using epsom salt, which in the end did work! While it's hard for me to really test it's true purity should be more then enough reactive enough for my amateur purposes.
