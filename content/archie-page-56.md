### The CAN CRUSHER!


#### I really gotta get better at naming things




### Goal and IDEation


Scan of notebook sketch


The goal of this project is to reduce the volume of "soda" cans by crushing them with a 3d printed device, there are two reasons for this:1. Allows extraction of Aluminum from soda cans, for chemistry projects and also easier for use in future home metal working projects2. Easier to throw awayI made this sketch of the idea for the device, alongside measurements of 12oz and 16oz cans. To get a feel for the project.

### OnShape Modeling


OnShape is a 3d modeling software that is used a lot in the engineering and design industry, i have wanted to learn this software for a while and finally spent my weekend learning it. OnShape is web based similar to TinkerCAD, but far more powerful and a lot similar to other modeling softwares like Fusion 360 and FreeCAD. Shown to the left is the model i made in OnShape, in It's explored view and colored. Here is the link to the most current model: LINK

### final touches


Initial model published


After 2 test prints i finally figured out some improvements i need to make some of these include:1. Vertical slit so you can see the progress of the can being crushed 2. Horz slit so you knew when to stop crushing 3. Expanding the bottom area so the final can easily slide through4. Remodeling the handle so that it can be gripped easier as opposed so the previous smooth finish5. Increase the size of the "cap" to get the handle to slide through much straighter
