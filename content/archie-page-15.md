# NOTES




##### This is a work in progress project


Many of the areas of text, images or information are not final and May contain erros




This is a page for a list of random notes and ideasÂ (some of them likely don't work or aren't finished)




#### natural electromagnetism wheel


(not sure if possible when factoring heatloss and required difference in force between positions)

#### hydroelectric power


Just basic notes on how hydroelectric power is actually more like a gravitational "generator"

#### Auto name


Idea for a system that would process files metadata, and the content of media itself, like the content of a image, to help automatically name and sort the user's data into a proper file structure meaning the users doesn't have to manually spend hours cleaning up file systems, naming files, or searching for misplaced/hidden files.

#### Ghost gear


A "ghost gear" is a type of gearbox that allows the able to change gear ratios without having to have many different gear sizes that have to be swhiched between. Instead it works on expanding itself while having the size of a much larger gear with the same teeth size. This system would likely work best using a chain as if you wanted to use 2 ghost gears to be directly intertwined you would have to have a system that makes sure the distance between the two ghost gears is correct for it's given ratio

#### "ekey"


The ekey is a basic idea for an adaptive keyboard and control system for a e-ink device. This would use clear buttons with a basic mounting system so they still act as proper buttons with machinal clicks. Because the keys would be clear the e ink panel at the bottom could be adaptive and change depending on the content being consumed (texting, audio player, etc) and also change between languages and custom key layouts. This system could also uses for other systems like a video editing board or changing between scenes during recording similar to a "stream deck"

#### "The Orbiter"


This would be a fun device that allows the user to throw a baseball sized drone and have it continue the momentum it was thrown with and also have it arc and bounce back towards the user if it reaches a wall or other barrier like a tree, as it were a perfect boomerang. Note: (the type of barrier detection system not outlined these notes)
