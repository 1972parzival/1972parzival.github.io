### Biodegradable Plastic Part 2


#### this time it's crispy and burnt




### Oven


I started off by cooking the cob at about ~150F for a extended period

### kernels


I was then able to easily remove the kernels from the cob with just my hand lightly on pulling them.

### Blend and drain


I then blended the kernels with a 1:1 ratio with water and got the paste, I then drained the paste using a towel the same as in part 1

### Baking


I put the flakes into the oven at 200 degrees for a 30 minute period

### Results: Failure


Sadly I was not able to get a viable plastic from this recipe. The result is merely a "burnt sludge", I think in the next part i will start from a corn starch and then work backwards to corn once i have a working system
