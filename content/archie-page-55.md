### Basic DC motor


#### a fun project to demonstrate basic knowledge of DC motor systems




### Principles


I've been researching electric motor, and electromagnetism in general for a while as i think it's a really interesting topic, here are some really good videos i found while researching the topic: Video 1Video 2Video 3the short explanation is that current flowing through the copper wire creates a magnetic field. By coiling the wire the magnetic field is dramatically amplified. This field is at certain point repelled to create mechanical power in the form of rotation. and over the last week and after about ~35 attempts, i managed to finally build and test my own little dc motor!

### Setup


The Setup of the motor is as follows1. Two chemical batteries (AA) providing a combined 3 volts2. Pair of alligator clips 3. Small amount of soldering wire to act as the "hooks"4. A permeant magnet5. Enameled copper wire (use a knife to remove the enamel on either side after you have built the coil)

#### Demo




#### Results


Overall i'm really happy with how it turned out even if i only managed to get ~30 seconds of solid spin time, It's amazing to see how these two forces of electricity and magnetism combine. I plan to do a lot more motor projects in the future such as a proper brush motor and then later a brushless motor.
