### Making a Piezoelectric


#### The Atomic Spring




### The Atomic Spring


One way to explain piezo electrics that i have not yet seen otherwhere, is the idea that piezo's are all in fact Springs. If you have a standard metal Spring and you compress it you turn force into elastic energy. If you have a piezo and you compress it you turn force into electrical energy, but this also workss inversely. If you have electrical energy you can turn it into force, not much force comparatively but it comes in the force of vibration. So if we can create vibration based a electrical signal, well we have just invented the speaker and if we can detect vibration based on a electrical signal, we have just invented the microphone. Those are the two applications i will be focusing on but there are many more such as using a lot of force all at once in a small spot to create arcs of high voltage ac for a short period, called piezoelectric ignition which we hit on during the RIS project.

### Intro and Setup


Photo of the materials


For this project i will attempting to make a piezoelectric crystal from scratch: This can be done from relatively easy to acquire materials. Maybe not in your cabinets already, but a short trip to the shops should give you more than what you need.

### Results


Overall this reaction is EXTREMELY slow it took me about a hour of slowly adding soda ash in small cups, water for the bubbles to settle and repeating until it became clear with a light yellow hue. After about 4 hours i started to see a Crystal formation near the top layer of liquid. After about 12 hours solid crystals had formed at the bottom of the plastic container. Finally after 48 hours i drained the crystal solution and left them over another 48 hours to dry fully.

#### Scope test


##### the output is hooked up to the scope not the direct audio channel. Audio is coming from the camera's own mic




#### Tap test


##### the output is hooked up to the camera's audio-in not the scope. Audio is coming from the piezo itself




#### table hit, blowing air, shouting hello test


##### the output is hooked up to the camera's audio-in not the scope. Audio is coming from the piezo itself




#### impact distance test


##### the output is hooked up to the camera's audio-in not the scope. Audio is coming from the piezo itself
