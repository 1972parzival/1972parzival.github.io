### Setup


Photo of the receiver powered up


The Setup is simple, we have two Ardunio Uno computers each hooked up to a Buzzer and a LoRa module. These buzzers will allow us to know that a signal has been sent or received with using a displays or hook each of them up to a computer to view a console. Log statement.

### Code


The codebase is broken into two parts: The code for the transmitter and the code for the receiverthe quick breakdown is this: The transmitter beeps over and over again, each beep occurs when a signal is sent When the receiver receives the correct signal from a transmitter it emit's a special chime of it's own. Both modules are totally independent and only need power to function all the code for this project is here for anyone to useinputoutput
