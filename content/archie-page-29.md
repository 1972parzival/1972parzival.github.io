### 3D Printed Shoes


#### shoes totally 3d printed using TPU and PLA




### Base


The base is what supports the users foot, it's printed in PLA to ensure that it is stable and secure when in use. The base is also what the Cover attaches on top of and what the footer attaches to the bottom of.

### Cover and Footer


The cover is what forms a major of the final product's shape. It is printed out of TPU which is very flexible, perfect as a replacement for the traditional fabrics covering a regular shoe.  The footer is made of TPU and is added to soften the impact of each step the user takes. Both of these sections are added to the base using superglue in this version but in the future methods like bolts and threads or rod connections could be utilized for a cleaner look.

I could really see this kind of design for a shoe, that is able to easily printed and produced to any size and shape working in 3rd world nations. As any children or parent would be able a perfectly fitting shoe for a cheap price. After doing some estimates these shoes can be fully printed at scale for between $4.00 to 6.50 USD. This cost could be reduce by a huge factor if it was pelletized plastic instead of filament
