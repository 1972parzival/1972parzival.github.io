### 1. Boil Water


I started off by boiling 1.7 liters of water in a normal kettle that took about 5 minutes to reach boiling point

### 2. Pour Boiling Water


Just simply pour the 1.7 liters of water into a container, i will be using this large metal bowl so that cooling occurs quicker later on. It also helpss to have a high surface area of the top layer of liquid.

### 3. Add tea bags


For tea bags I used "British Blend - Premium Black Tea". These contain on average 45 mg of caffeine per teabag I used 8 tea bags and let them brew over a period of 10 minutes.

### 4. Remove teabags


I removed the eight teabags into a glass cup, then drained them completely and re-poured the liquid into the solution.

### 5. Cooling


I then let the bowl and solution cool to room temp, this took about 40 minutes.

### 6. Refrigerate for 8 hours


I left it in the refrigerate for 8 hours after which crystals started to form on the surface of the solution

### 7. Filter


I poured solution into a sink through a traditional tea filter and collected the crystals from surface of the solution

### 8-9. Dry and Collect


I collected "paste" from the filter by ripping the filter open. I then let it dry in a window for 8 hours during the day. After that I collected the dry crystals into sample dish

### 10. Final result


YOUR DONE! Ready to use the caffeine for whatever homemade drinks you want. Overall I'm really happy with how this experiment went and it was a easy process that I could perform over a weekend. If I ever want to make any homemade energy drinks in the future this could be a awesome way to go to get caffeine in a quick, safe and cheap way
