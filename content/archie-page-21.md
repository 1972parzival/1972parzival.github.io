### Ultrasonic sensor case (HC-SR04)




### initial testing


Image Description


I printed out a publicly available model of the  Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04). I found that many of the measurements on this 3d model were not correct and off by 1-4mm in many areas. I adjusted the model so it reflected the correct size and then moved on.

### V1-V3


I then repeatedly tested the model over and over with the Ultrasonic sensor and found errors where i didn't account for small chips on the sensor's board. Or when the width of parts like the edges of the circles were too small leading to rapid breakage.
