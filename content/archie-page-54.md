### Biodegradable Plastic Part 6


#### breaking down materials needed recursively




#### making NaOH (sodium hydroxide electrolysis)




#### making Glycerol (Saponification of fats)




### Setup


For setup i'd really recommend fully watching the two video in order, this allows your to the create the Glycerol used in bioplastic totally at home! After that use the detailed process and outlined in part 4 using the Glycerol you created! Below is photos from where i did the process again, this time using lab equipment instead of kitchen equipment. But this change won't have a effect on the process taking place

### Results


After a extremely long boil time of about 20-30 minutes I got solution to turn into the same "goop" as in part 4. It looked almost identical apart from being slightly lower in viscosity, and also for a light "foil" layer on top of the final substance likely due to impurities in the Glycerol.
