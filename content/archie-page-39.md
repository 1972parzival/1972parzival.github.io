### Biodegradable Plastic Part 5


#### now with microscopes




#### Overview


Note: All samples were initially left in a window for a period of 3 weeks before all further testing shown in these results. All further sample testing took place over the same 7 day period I did this multivariable experiment to try and understand what results in the creation of bioplastic most similar and and strong to that of traditional plastic




### Sample A: On a window sill

### Results




-E and E2 are far better then all other samples-E has a hard structure and appears only slightly clear. It breaks over light amounts of force -E2 has a much much harder structure then E is a non clear white and only breaks under heavy force -There seems to be a direction relationship between the strength and hardness of a sample to it's glow under a ultraviolet black light (note that spooled PLA is also very reactive under ultraviolet light) -I have no idea why this occurs relationship occurs and i cannot find any public academic paper relating to or mentioning this subject.-E is quite flammable and emit's a slow cracking sound as it burns into a dark ash very similar in texture to a biochar.-overall E2 (full name: 4-E2) is the best by far, but more research needs to understand why and how it occurs in such an outdoor environment and how to refine it in a  consistent process that can be replicated by others.
