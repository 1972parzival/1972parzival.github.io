### Model


Screenshot of the paint version of A in AII3 logo


I started off by measuring the poster board using a ruler, I then got a previously created version of the AII3 logo in my modeling software and adjusted the horizonal width to just below that size. I then used that to create a "inverse" of the logo, then add supports for the inner sections and cut it up into the 3 key elements of A, I,3. Then exported each part as it's own STL and then printed it on my printer

### Painting


I painted this basic white poster board into a dark black using spray paint then let it settle for 2 days, after that I brought out the paint inverses and started to spray. It went well and I just pressed my palm into the supports to ensure no paint leakage. The only issue I ran into was that some paint did cross over on the horizonal edge of each inverse, leading to a light "mist" of paint in-between each letter when viewed up close.

### Result


After I finished painting used a iron tray and a weight to flatten out the poster, I then hung it up on my wall using thumbtacks. I'm really happy with the final result and I think it'll serve as motivation to keep working hard on projects in the future
