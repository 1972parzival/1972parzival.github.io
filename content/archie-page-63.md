#### pencil lead?




### Pencils?

Yes, pencils. Pencils contain graphite or what many refer to as pencil "lead" enough though it does not contain lead. Graphite is a awesome electrode for electroplating. And even though i did get some copper "flakes" in the past electroplating part from using a conductive filament, after a lot of futher testing and research from others i have concluded that conductive filament at least as it currently stands is not able to be used in electroplating effectively. After coming to this conclusion i tested a powdered form of graphite from a online supplier and still saw no success after trying it as a raw powder or in addition to glue and "painted" onto a surface (i think this failed as it was not a pure form of graphite somehow). After months of on and off testing i finally remembered the original fact about pencil "lead" and decided to try it, almost instantly after using it as a electrode did i see it burst to life and instantly start to plate the copper onto itself.
