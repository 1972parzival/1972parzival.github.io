### Using Basic Electrolysis to Change Water Into a Fuel Source




##### Electrolysis:


Electrolysis is the process of using electricity to split water into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. This is achieved by attracting hydrogen ions to the negative electrode (cathode) where they form hydrogen gas, and attracting oxygen ions to the positive electrode (anode) where they form oxygen gasWIKI




### Setup

The setup considered of 1. Two plastic tubes 2. One plastic lid3. One piece of clear tubing4. One 9 volt alkaline battery (left)5.1/4 cup of table salt (left)5.1/4 cup of water (both)6. One basic household lighterthe cathode in this Electrolysis experiment is the negative terminal of the battery, and the anode the positive terminal. We are not separating the oxygen and hydrogen gases from these terminals and they're mixed as they rise and go through the tube. When they're mixed they create a Oxyhydrogen gas this is a very powerful gas and has a low required ignition energy to combust. The tube on the right acts as a "one way water valve", it doesn't allow a ignition source to go further along the tub and spark a rapid ignition. Because of this valve all that should be produced is slow and steady amounts of Oxyhydrogen gas, in the form of bubbles on the surface of the water.

### Results

Overall the results were as expected the Oxyhydrogen gas was safe throughout the process. The only unexpected result was the rapid "rusting" of the battery over time, as it turned the salt water solution on the right side a dark black. I'm really glad with the results and I hope to do a much larger scale electrolysis system or a small Oxyhydrogen gas welder in the near future.
