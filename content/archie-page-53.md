### Making DIY cologne/perfume


#### More fun then it had any right to be




### Intro


Photo of the experiment in book


As I was cleaning my little chemistry lab in my basement i stumbled across a old chemistry set and book that discussed a bunch of different experiments that you could do at home. I set the chemicals aside for a later date, and read the whole book. The experiment that caught my eye was extremely simple, it discussed how to make perfume at home. The idea bounced around my head over the following and i decided to give it a shot for fun.

### The Process




##### Flowers


##### Flowers in a blender


##### grinder flowers placed into a test tube


##### cotton-ball inserted into the test tube filled with water


##### initial heating up of the test tube with the solution


##### Setup, flower solution evaporating in the tube then condensing into the cold tube


##### 2nd angle of setup

### Results

The final solution came out really well, it was completely clear and smelled exactly like the flowers with a amazingly strong sent for so little solution. The final smell also had a hint of "wet grass" so to speak likely due to me not only blending the pedals but much of the stem as well. Overall a great weekend project that people of all ages can do in 20 minutes with a little cleanup afterwards.
