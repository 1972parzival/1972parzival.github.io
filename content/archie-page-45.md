### Electroplating: Part 3


#### Testing the viability of conductive filament for later applications in projects




### Initial test


For the initial test I used conductive filament as the cathode (see part 1)  to try and get a deposition of copper onto the filament. The reason I am trying to do this is for future application in 3D printing projects to allow for the creation of PCB like systems. This initial test was a failure and after a lot of research and testing of the system with a multimeter, I believe it was due to the extreme resistance of the conductive filament. This lead to very little power reaching the area that was in the solution and therefore no copper deposition.

### Follow up test


To try and reduce the loss of power over distance, i swhiched to a much smaller container that allowed for a very short distance from the contact metal to the conductive filament in contact with the solution. This did work but the effect was still notable and you could clearly see how the charge and therefore deposition rapidly declines over distance. Still it was still proof that we a reasonably low charge (testing between 6v-11v) you can get copper deposition onto a printed piece of conductive filament
