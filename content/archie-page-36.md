### Biodegradable Plastic Part 3


#### now with corn starch.




### CORN STARCH!


I went down to the culinary classroom at my high school and was able to get a bag of corn starch to aid in this experiment. It's only enough for one try but if it works I'll know what to buy in the future.

### Mixing


I mixed the cornstarch in with the water and vinegar and then poured it into a metal tray

### Results


After 5 days the solution turned into flakes (not shown), it seemed a lot lot closer to plastic then part 1 or 2 but still not quite there yet. In the next part I will try adding some other suggested ingredients from academic papers that could aid in creating the plastic.
