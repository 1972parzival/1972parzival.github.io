### TPU Gearbelt




### The IDEa


I've had a lot of problems in the past trying to adapt existing rubber gear belts to work in 3d printed mechanical system. I then had that idea that TPU when printed in a shape that was the inverse of a larger gear when pair with a smaller gear made of PLA. Could act as a traditional belt system, this project is to test the validly of such an idea and see if the TPU can stand up to the rotational force and the frictional heat of a spinning motor

### The Demo System


The demo system is quite simple. It consists of a DC motor hook up to a power supply that can be adjusted to provide anywhere from 3-24.7 volts, that connects to a small PLA gear. On the other side is aÂ small PLA gear that is freely spun by a ball bearing held up by a PLA stand. Then of course we have the blue TPU belt.

##### So what?


Well the application of a TPU Gearbelt like this would to replace rubber in gear systems and increase the size and scale for 3d printed gear systems. Without the requirement of external material like rubber that cannot be adjusted in size or shape by the end user.
