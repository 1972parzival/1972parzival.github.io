### RIS


#### A Rapid Ignition System for small scale applications




### IDEation


Diagrams of current and some possible lighters (not all shown)


I've been doing a lot of research regarding lighters and i see of lot of potential in studying them and trying to improve on them. For this project i will be creating a RIS (rapid ignition system) that could be used in a lighter, homemade rocketry or in general controlled burns of gas or liquid propellents. This project will contain 3 major parts: The gears, the motor and the spark.

### Early Testing


Shown: The piezo igniter, worm and main gear, dc motor


For the gears i decided to just use 3D printing as that was the best for rapid prototyping and it should certainly be able to handle the force of rotation for this build. The configuration is a worm gear attached to the main gear which will later attach to a piston to create the linear motion required. The motor is a very basic dc motor with a rectangular shape which will be great at reducing depth of the final product. The spark is where the real magic happens it's created through piezoelectric ignition which was very interesting to read up on and try to understand. The short version is that when a large linear motion is applied, a small section hits quartz hard enough to generate a electrical arc between the wire and the metal cap.

### Initial Modeling


After a couple hours over 2 days i was able to measure, print and adjust over and over until i had a useable model in OnShape. On the top left in blue is the main holder for the piezo igniter. Then in gray there is the section that attaches at the back to act like a piston head, and is connected to the gear by the arm. The main gear is spinning based on a worm gear that attaches to a small dc motor near bottom left (not shown). The reason for the worm gear is so the motor hopefully has enough torque to successfully activate the piezo.

#### Notes on V1


-bending across the the edges of plastic instead of force applied on the piezo mechanism as intended. Could be resolved by a larger flat base with higher infill. Snapping of the center pivot
