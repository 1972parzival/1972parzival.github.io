### Soap Production


#### A mildly interesting exploration of a common hygiene product




### basic testing


Sorry for poor photo quality


To start off i got some basic soap and melted it down into 2 sections, added one with coffee to see how scent transfers and the other with colorant to see how soap absorbs. Overall it was a good test with the soap absorbing the coffee small. The issues being that when foaming on the skin it was brown instead of the more "tan" color i had hoped for. The colorant also pooled to the edges resulting in the first washes just coating the users hands in the different colors (even though they quickly fade).

### Cost calculation


Google sheet


I wanted to see what how far i had reduced the unit cost so i did some calculations based on the oil and NaOH i was using. In the end 1 soap bar ended up costing about 42 cents, at just a bit more then half a penny per gram after material loss. (See Bioplastic Part 6's Saponification of fats for details on the chemical process)

### Molding

By utilizing a Image to STL tool i converted the outline of the Minnesota state into a 3d model, which i then added to modeling software and built a mold around. Then printed using TPU to create a soft mold that i can push against to easily remove the final product
